# `pepsy.optimizers.mps.optimizer`

`MpsOptimizer` consumes canonical bundled gate streams of the form
`[(gate, where), ...]`. In `mode="mpo"` the stream can also contain explicit
sub-MPO events for already-factorized nonlocal operators:

```python
event = ("submpo", mpo, where)
# or
event = {"kind": "submpo", "mpo": mpo, "where": where}
```

`where` is a non-empty tuple/list of unique 1D MPS sites. The convenience
helper `MpsOptimizer.submpo_event(mpo, where)` builds the tuple form. These
events are applied with `gate_with_submpo_` and compressed to `chi`; they are
only accepted in `mode="mpo"`.

`mode="mix"` is a unitary gate-stream mode that warms up with MPO replay while
`p.max_bond() < chi`, then switches to DMRG replay once the working MPS reaches
the target bond. If a DMRG step raises or produces non-finite tensor data, the
optimizer restores the pre-step state and replays that step with MPO instead.
The mixed replay history is stored in `opt.mix_history` and summarized in
`opt.last_mix_summary`. With `progbar=True`, the progress bar shows the current
backend, cumulative MPO/DMRG/fallback counts, and `bond=current/chi`.

For a logical gate stream whose site order has not been chosen yet,
`MpsOptimizer.LayoutFinder(gates, L=...)` or
`MpsOptimizer.gate_stream_layout(gates, L=...)` returns a 1D layout plan with
the optimized site order, old-to-new site map, internal mapped locations, and
span statistics. The finder implementation lives in
`pepsy.optimizers.mps.layout.MpsGateStreamLayoutFinder`, while
`MpsOptimizer.LayoutFinder` keeps the attached optimizer-facing API. The finder
builds a weighted interaction graph from gate and
sub-MPO supports, scores layouts with a Tensy-like scalar objective
`weighted_total_span + weighted_cut_congestion_l2 + tail_span_penalty`, and
uses degree/BFS/spectral/recursive candidates plus adjacent-swap refinement. If
available, the refinement uses numba; `order="quality"` also tries optional
nevergrad candidates, and optional KaHyPar recursive bisection when a config is
provided with `kahypar_config_path=...` or `PEPSY_KAHYPAR_CONFIG`. Event weights
default to `weight_mode="auto"`: angle metadata when present, otherwise a cheap
operator-Schmidt proxy for small dense two-site gates, falling back to count
weights. Pass `weight_fn(payload, support, event_type)` for explicit weights.

The layout score depends on gate supports and optional gate/event weights, not
on the initial MPS tensor values. The plan does not rewrite the gate stream. To
use a layout during replay, call `opt.run(use_layout_finder=True)` or pass a
layout order such as `opt.run(use_layout_finder="quality")`; the optimizer
temporarily permutes the working MPS and restores the returned MPS to the
original site order. Layout-aware replay prints a concise report by default;
pass `layout_report=False` to silence it.
